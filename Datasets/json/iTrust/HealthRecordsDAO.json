It ensures data integrity and consistency by following\n * proper error handling procedures and utilizing the DAOFactory to manage database connections.\n * \n * Overall, the HealthRecordsDAO class serves as a bridge between the application and the database, providing a layer of abstraction\n * for managing health records and ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.\n */\npublic class HealthRecordsDAO {\n    // class implementation goes here\n}\n*/\n/**\n * The Variables class represents a collection of private variables used in the application.\n * These variables include a HealthRecordsBeanLoader and a DAOFactory.\n * \n * The HealthRecordsBeanLoader is responsible for loading health records data from a data source.\n * The DAOFactory is used to create data access objects for interacting with the database.\n * \n * This class provides encapsulation for these variables, ensuring that they are only accessible within the class.\n * \n * Overall, the Variables class serves as a container for important objects used in the application's data management process.\n */"
