If any errors are found during validation, a FormValidationException is thrown with\n * a list of errors.\n * \n * This class contains a single method, validate, which takes an ApptBean object as a parameter and performs the validation\n * process. The validate method checks if the comment field of the bean is null, and if not, it validates the format of the\n * comment using a predefined ValidationFormat. If any errors are found, they are added to an ErrorList object, and if the\n * ErrorList has errors, a FormValidationException is thrown.\n * \n * The ApptBeanValidator class does not have any constructors or instance variables, as it is designed to be a utility class\n * for validating ApptBean objects. It provides a simple and reusable way to validate appointment beans in a consistent manner.\n * \n * It is important to note that this class does not modify the input ApptBean object in any way, it only performs validation\n * checks on the comment field. Clients can use this class to ensure that their ApptBean objects meet the required validation\n * criteria before further processing or storage.\n */"
