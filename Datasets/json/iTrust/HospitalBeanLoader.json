It prepares the PreparedStatement object with the parameters from the HospitalBean object and returns the updated PreparedStatement object.\n * \n * Overall, the HospitalLoader class provides functionality to load HospitalBean objects from a ResultSet and prepare PreparedStatement objects for database operations related to hospitals.
