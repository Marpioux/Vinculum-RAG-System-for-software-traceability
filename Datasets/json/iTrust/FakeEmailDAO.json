Here is a comprehensive JavaDoc comment for the class:\n\n/**\n * This class is responsible for managing email records in a database. It provides methods for retrieving emails sent to a specific person based on their email address, as well as sending email records to the database.\n * \n * The main functionalities of this class include:\n * - Retrieving emails sent to a specific person based on their email address\n * - Sending email records to the database by inserting them into the FakeEmail table\n * \n * The behavior of this class is as follows:\n * - When retrieving emails for a specific person, the getEmailsForPerson() method is called with the person's email address as a parameter. This method returns a list of Email objects containing the emails sent to that person.\n * - When sending an email record to the database, the sendEmailRecord() method is called with the Email object to be saved as a parameter. This method inserts the email record into the FakeEmail table in the database.\n * \n * @param email the email address of the person to retrieve emails for\n * @return a list of Email objects containing the emails sent to the specified person\n * @throws DBException if there is an error accessing the database\n */\n \nI hope this helps clarify the purpose and functionality of the class! Let me know if you need any further assistance.\n/**\n * The FakeEmailDAO class is responsible for interacting with the database to retrieve and manipulate fake email data.\n * It provides methods for retrieving fake emails based on specific criteria, such as searching for a substring in the email body.\n * This class utilizes a DAOFactory for obtaining SQL connections and other resources necessary for database operations.\n * \n * The main functionalities of the FakeEmailDAO class include:\n * - Retrieving a list of emails that contain a specific substring in their body\n * - Loading and parsing email data from the database using an EmailBeanLoader\n * \n * The behavior of the FakeEmailDAO class is as follows:\n * - It connects to the database using the provided DAOFactory\n * - It executes SQL queries to retrieve fake email data based on the specified criteria\n * - It returns a list of Email objects that meet the search criteria, ordered by added date in descending order\n * - It handles exceptions by throwing a DBException if there is an error accessing the database\n * \n * Note: It is important to ensure that the DAOFactory provided to the FakeEmailDAO constructor is not null to avoid IllegalArgumentExceptions.\n */\n**/"
