Implementing classes are expected to\n * provide concrete implementations for the defined methods.\n * \n * The main functionalities of this interface include:\n * - Inserting a new dish into the system\n * - Modifying an existing dish in the database\n * - Deleting a dish from the menu based on its ID\n * - Retrieving a list of dishes in a menu based on the menu ID\n * \n * Implementing classes should ensure that the methods in this interface are implemented\n * in a way that accurately reflects the behavior of the underlying database system.\n * \n * It is important to note that the methods in this interface may throw SQLExceptions, and\n * implementing classes should handle these exceptions appropriately.\n */"
